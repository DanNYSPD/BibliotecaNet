This application was developed as part of social service (volunteering) for the town of Orizaba in the state of Veracruz in Mexico.


Reduced the search time for people of the city of Orizaba when they enter into the library and check the existence and availability of books in which they are interested.

To simplify the insertion of more records for the library staff as well as to improve the portability when they change equipment this application uses an excel sheet as a source of data for the query process.
